<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Our team collaborated utilizing SCRUM/AGILE methodology. This application was integrated using a [back-end](https://github.com/Debug-Thugs-Rock/back-end-server) api that allows a user to sign up, sign in, change password, and sign out. Once signed in, the user is able to create a new post, entering the post title and content on a form. The logic, user and post forms, and styling were handled locally on the client through our own code. The design was inspired by bubbles, so we used light colors and rounded styling. 

With our bubble design in mind, this [wireframe](images/wireframe.jpg) was developed before starting on development. The repository for the back-end can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Debug-Thugs-Rock/back-end-server).
